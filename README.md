# Programming Fundamentals in Java

This repository contains my complete journey through Programming Fundamentals, covering core Java concepts through hands-on coding.

---

## Concepts Covered

### Conditional Statements

- `if-else` statements with multiple logic-building examples
- `switch` statements written in different styles for flexibility

### Loops

- Mastery of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Looping through primitive types, strings, and arrays

### Methods

- Simple reusable methods
- Method Overloading
- `pass by value` explained through examples

### 1D Arrays

- Array creation, access, and manipulation
- Passing arrays to methods and returning them
- Looping through arrays with different data types

### 2D Arrays

- Nested loop mastery
- Row-wise and column-wise operations
- Matrix-based logic problems

### Jagged Arrays

- Dynamic array structures
- Sum, product, and flattening operations
- Fully user-driven input and structured output

### Error/Exception Handling

- Simple codes for error handling
- `try` , `catch` , `throws` and `finally`
- Make your code error free and functioning without crashing

## Notes

- Some commits may have shifted due to restructuring â€” check filenames and descriptions accordingly.
- Each `.java` file in this repo represents a small, focused concept or challenge.
- All code is written with clarity and output in mind for better understanding.

## Practice Habit

By building small programs every day, I'm sharpening logic, mastering Java syntax, and preparing for real-world problem solving.
